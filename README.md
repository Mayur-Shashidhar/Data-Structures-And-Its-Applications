# Data Structures And Its Applications

Welcome to the **Data Structures And Its Applications** repository!

## Overview

This repository is focused on the implementation of various data structures using the C programming language. It is intended to provide practical examples and applications of fundamental data structures, making it an excellent resource for students, educators, and anyone seeking to strengthen their understanding of data structures in C.

## Features

- Implementations of common data structures in C
- Source code designed for learning and reference
- Open for contributions and improvements

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Mayur-Shashidhar/Data-Structures-And-Its-Applications.git
```

Make sure you have a C compiler installed (such as GCC). Navigate into the project directory and compile the files as needed.

## Data Structures Included

- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees
- Graphs
- Hash Tables

*(Note: The specific implementations will be visible in the source files of the repository.)*

## Usage

Each data structure comes with sample code demonstrating its usage. Open the relevant `.c` file and compile it using your preferred C compiler, for example:
```sh
gcc linked_list.c -o linked_list
./linked_list
```
